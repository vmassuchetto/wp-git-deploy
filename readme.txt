Deploy websites using Git and the admin bar.

== Description ==

This is a plugin for managing website releases under production or development
environments. Once the WordPress installation is in a Git tree, WP Deploy will
detect its branches and put a switch menu in the admin bar.

Like this, you can just push your website to your remote and use the menu to
deploy the changes without using Git hooks or prompting into another shell.

Another useful purpose is for the development process, where different
implementations can be viewed and switched by customers, or a production branch
can be testes in a staging environment.

== Installation ==

1. Download and activate the plugin.
2. Check the 'Deploy' menu in your admin bar.
